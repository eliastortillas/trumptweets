```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(rjson)
trump.tweets <- fromJSON(file = "~/Documents/R/math311/condensed_2018.json")
n <- length(trump.tweets) 
trump <- matrix(nrow = n, ncol = 2)
for (i in 1:n) {
  trump[i,] <- c(trump.tweets[[i]]$created_at,
                 trump.tweets[[i]]$text)
}
trump <- as.data.frame(trump)
colnames(trump) <- c("date.time", "text")
trump$date <- as.Date(substr(trump$date.time, 1, 10), format = "%a %b %d %t")
trump$time <- substr(trump$date.time, 12, 19)
```

Let's take a peak at our dataset. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(knitr)
kable(trump[1:3,])
```

We'll start by answer the question of who Trump is talking about the most. We'll look at the most frequent mentions. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
# Who does Trump mention most on Twitter
library(stringr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
mentions <- NULL
for (i in 1:nrow(trump)) {
  x <- str_split(trump$text[i], pattern = " ", simplify = T)
  mentions <- c(mentions, str_subset(x, pattern = "^@"))
}
bad <- c("!",",", ":")
for (i in 1:3) {
  mentions <- str_replace(mentions, bad[i], "")
}
most.mentions <- 
  mentions %>%
  table %>%
  data.frame %>%
  filter(Freq >= 3) %>%
  arrange(Freq)
most.mentions$. <- factor(most.mentions$., levels = most.mentions$.)
ggplot(most.mentions) + 
  geom_bar(aes(., Freq), stat = "identity") +
  ggtitle("Who does Trump mention most on Twitter?",
          subtitle = expression("no. of mentions" >= 3)) +
  coord_flip()

```

IDEAS: 
1. When does Trump speak about people throughout the year?
2. What words does he use to speak about them?
3. Correlate with news/Google Trends.
4. Correlate with popularity. See 538.
